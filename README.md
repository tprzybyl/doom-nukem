# doom-nukem

A complete graphic project. Creating a new 3D engine using portals algorithme mostly, with the SDL2

You can change some parameters in the doom.h located in the includes folder. You will have to compile again however. You must have apt-get installed and type down "make sdl", then you can make normally!

DISCLAIMER : This is the project as it was given the first time it was validated at the school, it is not being updated since. I will keep those projects as they were made first.
